                    Employing a solar pool cover will assist in heating pool water and help conserve money on utility bills.
                     Solar blankets are commonly available in a rectangular form factor for both above and in-ground pools. 
                     Solar pool covers are extremely powerful that can raise your water temperature by as much as 15 degrees with the power of the sun.
                     It absorbs and traps the energy of the sun without using a gas heater or propane pool heater, therefore allowing you to save 50%-70% on your heating bill.
                     Therefore, you not only will be saving money but, helping the envirement by using this green energy heating form factor.
                     A solar cover maintains the sun’s warmth in the water during the evening when it starts to get colder as the summer season fades. 
                     By preserving the pool water warm, you’re spreading the enjoyment you can achieve in the pool for the season. 
                     This is functional in the spring when the day starts to get mild but isn’t too warm. 
                     The solar cover can kick start the heating process and get you in the pool early.

                    Solar pool covers are remarkably similar to very strong bubble wraps that sit on the top of the pool. 
                    It connects to the pool as surface pressure, and its weight holds onto the exterior. 
                    One side includes the bubbles while the other side holds a strong flat layer. 
                    The bubbles assist as an insulator to prevent heat transfer out of the pool. <br><br>

• It hovers on the surface of the pool and allows the sun's rays to enter the pool to heat the water. <br>
• It serves as a massive blanket and insulates the pool increasing heat preservation, especially during the evening and during the breezy climate.<br>
• No water is exposed to the air, evaporation is greatly reduced. As a result, you continually won't be needing to add more water.<br>

        <h5>Overview</h5>
                <p class="description neev"><br>
                    Pros:<br><br>
• Permits the sun's rays to warm up the water in the pool<br>
• Maintains heat in the pool by protecting the pool water from the air above<br>
• Environmentally friendly (electricity bill friendly) as minor use of pool heater<br>
• Preserves water from less water evaporation as it shields the entire surface of the pool<br>
• No non-renewables sources are used in the manafacturing and use of the product <br>
• Minor use of chemicals as the pool being sheltered helps block UV rays which break down chlorine<br>
• Stop Debree from coming in since the tarp will block it<br>
• Extends the duration of swimming from heating up earlier in spring and long into the fall<br>
• No long term enviremental harm and waste products involved<br><br>

Cons:<br><br>
• The starting expense is somewhat pricy for the cover and a roller<br>
• Additional labor applied in extracting the cover<br>
• The covers have a life span so, need replacing from time to time<br>
• The covers have a life span so, need replacing from time to time<br>
• Potensial live risk from other organisms being trapped under the cover<br>
